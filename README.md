# learn-python-the-hard-way

Exercise 0

- Author gives instructions for Python setup (OSX, Microsoft and Linux)
- Author suggests TextWrangler text editor for OSX

Exercise 1 - A Good First Program

- ex1.py file contains:
print "Hello World"
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this"
print "This is fun."
print "Yay! Printing."
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

- First exercise try to show how to use text editor and commandline as a start
- Study Drills:
  - Add new print line
  - Print just one line
  - What is #

Exercise 2 - Comments and Pound Characters

- ex2.py contains:
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this. "  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

- Second exercise tell us how important comments are
- Try to show the general usage of # 
- Study Drills:
  - Read the code backwards (This helps programmers brain to not attach the meaning of each part)
